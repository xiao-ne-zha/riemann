# Version 0.2.11

This update includes a variety of bug fixes and improvements. Also
included is a VictorOps integration, improvements to the Graphite, Xymon,
InfluxDB, Hipchat and Nagios integrations.

- Fix logging, use logback instead log4j, (import log levels from
  `ch.qos.logback.classic` instead of `org.apache.log4j`)
- `by-fn` now expects the new-fork argument to be a 1-arity function
- pagerduty requires the service-key to be passed as a key named `service-key`
  rather than directly as a string.
  eg: `(let [pd (pagerduty :service-key "my-service-key")]`

# Version 0.2.8

Minor followup release: fixes a bug in 0.2.7 which broke TCP servers on
non-linux platforms.

## Bugfixes

- TCP transport now uses epoll only on Linux platforms, Java NIO otherwise.


# Version 0.2.7

Performance improvements and important bugfixes: 0.2.7 is long overdue. New
integrations with Blueflood, Logentries, Opsgenie, Cloudwatch, Mailgun, Xymon,
Datadog, and Twilio.

## Bugfixes

- Stackdriver: fix a shadowing warning
- Debian package now recommends Java
- Debian package launches Riemann on boot by default
- riemann test command now actually exists, works from startup scripts
- Indexes no longer disappear on config reload

## Deprecations and API changes

- Riemann-clojure-client and riemann-java-client 0.3.x, included in riemann
  0.2.7, return asynchronous results by default. `streams/forward` is still
  synchronous, but if you're invoking clients manually, make sure to `deref`
  results from `send-event` etc.

## New features

- Dynamic loading of dependencies via the new plugin system
- Logentries integration
- Blueflood integration
- Xymon integration
- Mailgun integration
- Opsgenie integration
- Cloudwatch integration
- Datadog integration
- Twilio integration
- Slack adapter allows incoming webhooks
- OpenTSDB server

## Improvements

- Logstash now sends events without metrics
- You can set log4j options via a properties file
- Aggressive JVM opts now includes -server
- Various docstring improvements
- Optimizations to zero- and single-argument forms of `sdo`
- Faster startup and shutdown for TCP/UDP servers
- `streams/with` can work with vectors of events, perf improvements
- More type hints in performance-critical paths

## Internals

- clj-librato 0.0.5
- Aleph and Lamina are now completely removed. Improves startup times and jar
  sizes.
- Websocket and SSE transports now based on httpkit. No instrumentation for
  httpkit latencies sadly.
- Upgrade from Netty 3 to Netty 4.0.21. Should see reduced CPU, slightly higher
  throughput. Uses the epoll transport.
- New mock macro in riemann.test-utils for testing integration streams.
- riemann-clojure-client 0.3.1

# Version 0.2.6

Improvements to ease of use, expanded integration with other monitoring tools,
and important bugfixes. Most importantly, we've added two new features: the
`pipe` stream, which makes it easy to split and recombine events through a
cascading series of streams, and riemann.test infrastructure for writing
repeatable tests for your config's streams. There's also new support for two
new services: stackdriver and Shinken, and a change to the officially supported
JDK versions.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.2.5 (due to a change in Clojure's destructuring
  bind defaults for maps) which caused exceptions when expiring events without
  a TTL.
- JSON-decoded events from the HTTP PUT endpoint now have correct timestamps;
  they were 1000x too large.
- Package md5sums now have two spaces.
- Equivalent indexes are no longer wiped between reloads.
- `(where (tagged "foo"))` now fully qualifies its expanded form; works when
  `tagged-any` or `tagged-all` isn't in the invoking namespace.

## Deprecations and API changes

- `streams/within` and `streams/without` are deprecated; bounds logic was
  ambiguous. Use `(where (< 1 metric 2))` etc.
- config/include now only loads .clj and .config files when given a directory.
  Now you can mix resources and other files into those directories.
- JDK6 is no longer supported, though it'll probably keep working for a while.
- JDK8 is now supported.

## New features

- streams/pipe: Easily create n->m->l-wide manifolds of streams.
- Testing configs! See the howto or 6ea82e07 for details.
- Stackdriver integration.
- Shinken integration.
- streams/changed now takes a `:pairs?` option, which emits `[old-event
  new-event]` pairs when the predicate value changes.

## Improvements

- You can now match `nil` in `where`, `split`, and other Match expressions.
- You can now match maps in `where`, `split`, etc: given a map of keys to Match
  predicates, asserts that for all keys in the predicate map, the corresponding
  value in the target map matches the predicate's value.
- Slack integration can take a custom formatter function.
- Influxdb configurable service names.
- Docstring improvements for `streams/ewma`, `rate`, `with`, and `default`.
- Websocket conn logs are now `debug`, not `info`.

## Internals

- Clojure.complete is no longer required.
- Interval-metrics 1.0.0
- streams-test/run-stream is now a part of riemann.test, and advances time.

# Version 0.2.5

All kinds of goodies! We're long overdue for a release, with five new service
integrations, a host of performance and correctness improvements, streamlined
packaging, new folds for combining events, and new streams for high-throughput
IO. Plus we've added lots of documentation, cleaned up some inconsistent
corners of the API, and improved error messages for common mistakes. All of
this should make for a faster and easier-to-use Riemann. Happy monitoring!

## Bugfixes
- Connection pools with block-start :true work correctly now
- /etc/default/riemann is now a conffile; won't be overwritten by upgrades
- Correct location for defaults file on redhat OSes
- Default value for localhost name
- streams/top correctly emits records to both top and bottom streams
- Indexing an expired event removes it from the index, rather than being a noop
- riemann.pool and riemann.time log exceptions in correct format
- Fix a race condition (?) in websocket connection close leading to dangling
  connections
- folds/mean: fix divide-by-zero where events are present but all have nil
  metrics
- folds/maximum and folds/minimum return nil when no metrics present
- Internal instrumentation events had ttls 1000x larger than they should have
- Debian package: pidofproc was mis-spelled; broke init scripts on jessie
- streams/sreduce docstring lied about what its example did
- Events from the TCP and UDP servers now receive default timestamps

## Deprecations and API changes
- update-index is now deprecated; indexes are also streams now
- Combine is deprecated in favor of smap
- Incanter is no longer included by default; cuts 14MB off the jar (!)
- coalesce flushes all known events downstream *periodically*, rather than once
  for every incoming event. Users were using coalesce for much broader
  cardinalities than originally intended, which led to performance problems.
  This change introduces additional latency into stream processing (on the
  order of dt seconds), but dramatically improves throughput for broad
  cardinalities. API is backwards-compatible; assumes a default interval of 1
  second.
- Most functions that took kwargs (foo :opt1 "a" :opt2 "b") now take maps for
  consistency and ease of composition. API is backwards compatible, but I will
  deprecate the old style in a few releases.

## New features
- folds/count-unexpired: counts unexpired events
- Improved metrics for async-queue executors
- config/reinject: reinsert events back into the core. Watch out for infinite
  loops!
- streams/batch: emit batches of events every dt seconds or n events, whichever
  comes first. Huge performance boost for integration services which support
  collections of events.
- streams/smapcat: like streams/map, but expects its function to return a
  sequence of events, each of which is sent downstream independently. Inverse
  of coalesce, project, etc.
- The (event) function can be used to create events with default times and
  faster kv lookup. You should probably use (event) instead of creating new
  events as hashmaps.
- Configurable log formats, including json events
- Hipchat integration
- KairosDB integration
- OpenTSDB integration
- Slack integration
- InfluxDB integration

## Improvements
- Indexes can be used directly as streams; no need to wrap them in update-index
- Removed blank lines in logs
- Query compiler caches 128 most recently used queries; 240x speedup in rapid
  repeated queries, massive reduction in GC pressure
- Queries for *exactly* one host and one service have an optimized query path.
- Retuned async-queue defaults for IO pools: more threads by default now
- streams/changed, streams/part-time-fast-interval, streams/sum-over-time,
  streams/mean-over-time, streams/register, streams/append,
  streams/fold-interval, streams/fill-in, streams/fill-in-last,
  streams/interpolate-constant, streams/ddt-events, streams/by-fn, and
  streams/by use atoms, not refs; ~10x speedup
- streams/top can take any comparable objects, not just numbers
- Index throws a more informative error message when events have nil times.
- Logs can be rotated by size
- Console logging can be disabled
- Better docs for async-queue!
- Assorted docstring improvements
- RPM package uses sysconfig
- Websocket server: friendlier logging for errors given non-websocket requests
- streams/forward can take collections of events
- Graphite server: accepts multiple spaces and tabs as separators
- Graphite server: much more robust parsing, error logging
- Librato integration uses persistent connection pool
- Hipchat integration included in config by default
- Hipchat can take collections of events

nonfatal bug in the websocket server, introduced in 0.2.3.

## Bugfixes

- Packages generate correct md5sums by default
- Tarball package logs to cwd, not /var/log/riemann.log.
- Aleph 0.3.1: fixes a bug which caused websockets to crash on the first conn

## Internals

- Explicit gen-class for riemann.bin; aids in embedding Riemann in Java
- Early work towards testable configs

# Version 0.2.3

Riemann continues to expand in scope and adaptability, especially adding
support for integration with other monitoring systems. Metrics for riemann
internals are now recorded and exposed as events through the standard streams.

# Version 0.2.1

This is a small maintenance release to address a few issues with 0.2.0: most
notably, an accidental transitive dependency on a snapshot release of Yammer
Metrics which is no longer available.

## New features

- streams/runs: detects runs of successive events.

## Improvements

- Various documentation fixes.
- Riemann.pool uses a LinkedBlockingQueue--reports improved performance.

## Bugfixes

- Fix dependencies on Aleph and Lamina which relied on a snapshot variant of
  Yammer Metrics.
- Debian package init script reports "already running" when appropriate.
- Debian package depends on Java.
- (streams core) is no longer lazy (fixes a possible threading issue).

## Internals

- Some utility functions for emails got moved to riemann.common, to facilitate
  their re-use.

# Version 0.2.0

Guess it's time we started a formal changelog. Version 0.2.0 is a fairly major
improvement in Riemann's performance and capabilities. Many things have been
solidified, expanded, or tuned, and there are a few completely new ideas as
well.

There are a few minor API changes, mostly to internal structure--but a few
streams are involved as well. Most functions will continue to work normally,
but log a deprecation notice when used.

## New features

- Arbitrary key-value (string) pairs on events
- Hot config reloading
- Integrated nrepl server
- streams/sdo: bind together multiple streams as one
- streams/split: like (cond), dispatch an event to the first matching stream
- streams/splitp: like split, but on the basis of a specific predicate
- config/delete-from-index: explicitly remove (similar) events from the index
- streams/top: streaming top-k
- streams/tag: add tags to events
- RPM packaging
- Init scripts, proper log dirs, and users for debian and RPM packages. Yeah,
  this means you can /etc/init.d/riemann reload, and Stuff Just Works (TM).
- folds/difference, product, and quotient.
- Folds come in sloppy and strict variants which should "Do What I Mean" in
  most contexts.
- Executor Services for asynchronous queued processing of events.
- streams/exception-stream: captures exceptions and converts them to events.

## Improvements

- http://riemann.io site
- Lots more documentation and examples
- Config file syntax errors are detected early
- Cleaned up server logging
- Helpful messages (line numbers! filenames!) for configuration errors
- Silence closed channel exceptions
- Cores can preserve services like pubsub, the index, etc through reloads
- Massive speedups in TCP and UDP server throughput
- streams/rate works in real-time: no need for fill-in any more
- Graphite client is faster, more complete
- Config files can include other files by relative path
- streams/coalesce passes on expired events
- riemann.email/mailer can take custom :subject and :body functions
- riemann.config includes some common time/scheduling functions
- streams/where returns whether it matched an event, which means (where) is
  now re-usable as a predicate in lots of different contexts.
- streams/tagged-any and tagged-all return whether they matched
- streams/counter is resettable to a particular metric, and supports expiry
- Bring back "hyperspace core online"
- Update to netty 3.6.1
- Reduced the number of threadpools used by the servers
- Massive speedup in Netty performance by re-organizing execution handlers
- core/reaper takes a :keep-keys option to specify which fields on an event
  are preserved
- streams/smap ignores nil values for better use with folds
- Update to aleph 0.3.0-beta15
- Config files ship with emacs modelines, too

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug in part-time-fast causing undercounting under high contention
- Catch exceptions while processing expired events
- Fix a bug escaping metric names for librato
- riemann.email/mailer can talk to SMTP relays again
- graphite-path-percentiles will convert decimals of three or more places to
  percentile strings
- streams/rollup is much more efficient; doesn't leak tasks
- streams/rollup aggregates and forwards expired events instead of stopping
- Fixed a threadpool leak from Netty
- streams/coalesce: fixed a bug involving lazy persistence of transients
- streams/ddt: fixed a few edge cases

## Internals

- Cleaned up the test suite's logging
- Pluggable transports for netty servers
- Cores are immutable
- Service protocol: provides lifecycle management for internal components
- Tests for riemann.config
- riemann.periodic is gone; replaced by riemann.time
- Tried to clean up some duplicated functions between core, config, and streams
- riemann.common/deprecated
- Cleaned up riemann.streams, removing unused commented-out code
- Lots of anonymous functions have names now, to help with profiling
- Composing netty pipeline factories is much simpler
- Clojure 1.5

## Known bugs

- Passing :host to websocket-server does nothing: it binds to * regardless.
- Folds/mean throws when it receives empty lists
- graphite-server has no tests
- Riemann will happily overload browsers via websockets
- streams/rate doesn't stop its internal poller correctly when self-expiring
- When Netty runs out of filehandles, it'll hang new connections
